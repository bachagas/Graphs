Graphs
======

Project for basic graphs manipulations and exercises.

Project Structure:
------------------

The project is organized in the following packages:

1) datastructures: graph basic data structures
  - Node: a generic graph node
  - Graph: a generic graph stored as an adjacency list. Provides basic methods for graph traversal (DFS and BFS) and some other derived and classical problems

2) test: classes for unit testing

3) puzzle: classes for classic "toy problems" and exercises

4) utils: some ohter utilities we needed.
