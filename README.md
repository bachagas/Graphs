Graphs
======

Project for basic graphs manipulations and exercises.

Project Structure:
------------------

The project is organized in the following packages:

1) datastructures: graph basic data structures
  - Node: a generic graph node
  - Graph: a generic graph stored as an adjacency list. Provides basic methods for graph traversal (DFS and BFS) and some other derived and classical problems

2) puzzle: classes for the classic "toy problem" of a 3 x 3 puzzle board game

3) utils: some other utilities and stuff we needed.
